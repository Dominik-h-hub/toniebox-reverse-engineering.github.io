If you have installed the HackieboxNG Bootloader you should already have those files in your backup. If not, you should install HackieboxNG. This will allow to to read and write files from/to microSD and flash by booting the Hackiebox CFW. Please drop the three .der files to /certs/client/.
Read certificates via Hackiebox CFW # You may use wget to download the certificates or just copy the url into your browser and save them manually.</description></item><item><title>CC3235</title><link>https://tonies-wiki.revvox.de/docs/tools/teddycloud/setup/dump-certs/cc3235/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tonies-wiki.revvox.de/docs/tools/teddycloud/setup/dump-certs/cc3235/</guid><description>CC3235 # You&amp;rsquo;ll have to manually extract it from the flash of the box with a SOP8 clamp directly from the memory or by desoldering it. Reading in-circuit can be tricky, but is possible. I recommend flashrom as tool for that. It may be necessary to use a more recent version of it.
Reading the flash with Pico # As a probe you may use a raspberry pi pico with the serprog protocol firmware for it.</description></item><item><title>ESP32</title><link>https://tonies-wiki.revvox.de/docs/tools/teddycloud/setup/dump-certs/esp32/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tonies-wiki.revvox.de/docs/tools/teddycloud/setup/dump-certs/esp32/</guid><description>ESP32 # You can extract the flash memory via the debug port of the box and the esptool. Keep your backup! Please use a recent version of esptool. (&amp;gt;v4.4) Please connect the jumper J100 (Boot) and reset the box to put it into the required UARTmode. Connect your 3.3V UART to J103 (TxD, RxD, GND).
If connected with the Boot jumper, the box just start in &amp;ldquo;DOWNLOAD (USB/UART0)&amp;rdquo; mode (Check with a serial monitor) and the LED will be off.</description></item></channel></rss>
