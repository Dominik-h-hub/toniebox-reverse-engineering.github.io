# CC3200
It is recommended to flash the replacement CA to /cert/c2.der and use the hackiebox-ng bootloader with the altCA patch. This will allow you to switch between the original and your replacement certificate. If you have installed the [HackieboxNG Bootloader](/docs/custom-firmware/cc3200/hackieboxng-bl/) and the [Hackiebox CFW](/docs/custom-firmware/cc3200/hackiebox-cfw) you may upload the certificate via the webinterface of the CFW. Otherwise you can use the cc3200tool for this task.

## Flash c2.der via Hackiebox
First of all please boot the [Hackiebox CFW](/docs/custom-firmware/cc3200/hackiebox-cfw), which should be in cfw1, so blue 1.
![Hackiebox CFW File Upload C2.der](HackieboxCfwFileUploadC2.png)
* Open the its webinterface (https://<box-ip>) and switch to Expert-File Upload.
* Select Target `Flash`
* Select your `certs/server/ca.der` from teddyCloud
* Enter `/cert/c2.der` as SD/Flash path

## Flash c2.der via cc3200tool
```
cc3200tool -p COM3 write_file certs/server/ca.der /cert/c2.der
```

## Additional
**Beware** The ```blockCheckRemove.310```, ```noCerts.305``` and the ```noHide.308``` patch breaks the content passthrough to Boxine. Please disable them by removing them in the [```ngCfg.json```](/docs/custom-firmware/cc3200/hackieboxng-bl/bootloader/#configuration) on the SD card if you previously enabled them.
