# CC3200
It is recommended to flash the replacement CA to /cert/c2.der and use the hackiebox-ng bootloader with the altCA patch. This will allow you to switch between the original and your replacement certificate. If you have installed the HackieboxNG Bootloader and the Hackiebox CFW you may upload the certificate via the webinterface of the CFW.
```
cc3200tool -p COM3 write_file certs/server/ca.der /cert/c2.der
```
**Beware** The ```blockCheckRemove.310```, ```noCerts.305``` and the ```noHide.308``` patch breaks the content passthrough to Boxine. If you are using firmware 3.1.0_BF4 isn't compatible with many patches, except the alt* ones. Please disable them by removing them in the [```ngCfg.json```](https://toniebox-reverse-engineering.github.io/docs/custom-firmware/cc3200/hackieboxng-bl/bootloader/#configuration) on the SD card.
