# CC3235
You'll have to manually extract it from the flash of the box with a SOP8 clamp directly from the memory or by desoldering it. Reading in-circuit can be tricky, but is possible. I recommend flashrom as tool for that. It may be necessary to use a more recent version of it.
You can use the [cc3200tool](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/cc3200tool) to extract your certificates from the flash dump.
```
cc3200tool -if cc32xx-flash.bin -d cc32xx read_all_files extract/
```

[Please continue with flash CA step for the CC3235](../../flash-ca/cc3235)
