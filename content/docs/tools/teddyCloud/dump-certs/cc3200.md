# CC3200
You can use the [cc3200tool](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/cc3200tool) to dump your certificates over the Tag Connect debug port of the box. If you have installed the HackieboxNG Bootloader you should already have those files in your backup.
```
cc3200tool -p COM3 read_file /cert/ca.der cert/ca.der read_file /cert/private.der cert/private.der read_file /cert/client.der cert/client.der
```

[Please continue with flash CA step for the CC3200](../../flash-ca/cc3200)
