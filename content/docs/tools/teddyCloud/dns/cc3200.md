# CC3200 with altUrl patch
With a CC3200 box it is recommened to use the altUrl patch. Set the DNS entries for ```prod.revvox``` and ```rtnl.revvox``` to the TeddyCloud servers ip-address.
If you have a fritzbox you can use the [altUrl tc.fritz.box](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/hackiebox_cfw_ng/blob/master/sd-bootloader-ng/bootmanager/sd/revvox/boot/patch/altUrl.tc.fritz.box.json) patch. You'll just have to set the name of your server in your fritzbox to ```tc``` (Heimnetz -> Netzwerk -> Netzwerkverbindungen -> bearbeiten
).
You may also edit the patch yourself to set the ip-address directly. Please beware, it should not be longer than the original url, which is 12 characters.
