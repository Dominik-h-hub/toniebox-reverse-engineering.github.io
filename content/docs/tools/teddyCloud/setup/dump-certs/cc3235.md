# CC3235
You'll have to manually extract it from the flash of the box with a SOP8 clamp directly from the memory or by desoldering it. Reading in-circuit can be tricky, but is possible. I recommend flashrom as tool for that. It may be necessary to use a more recent version of it.

## Reading the flash with Pico
As a probe you may use a raspberry pi pico with the [serprog protocol firmware](https://github.com/stacksmashing/pico-serprog) for it.
```
flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/ttyACM0:921600 -r cc32xx-flash.bin --progress
```
You may do multiple reads and compare the result
```
flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/ttyACM0:921600 -r cc32xx-flash.2.bin --progress
diff cc32xx-flash.bin cc32xx-flash.2.bin #no output = equal
```

## Extract certificates
You can use the [cc3200tool](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/cc3200tool) to extract your certificates from the flash dump afterwards.
```
cc3200tool -if cc32xx-flash.bin -d cc32xx read_all_files extract/
```
