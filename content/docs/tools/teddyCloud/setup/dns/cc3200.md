# CC3200 with altUrl patch
With a CC3200 box it is recommened to a altUrl patch. As a standard the fritzbox patch is set in HackieboxNG **ofw2**. The configuration file can be edited on your microSD (`sd:/revvox/boot/ngCfg.json`).

## fritz.box
If you have a fritzbox you can use the [altUrl.tc.fritz.box](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/hackiebox_cfw_ng/blob/master/sd-bootloader-ng/bootmanager/sd/revvox/boot/patch/altUrl.tc.fritz.box.json) patch. You'll just have to set the name of your server in your fritzbox to ```tc``` (Heimnetz -> Netzwerk -> Netzwerkverbindungen -> bearbeiten).

## Other (custom dns)
The [altUrl.305](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/hackiebox_cfw_ng/blob/master/sd-bootloader-ng/bootmanager/sd/revvox/boot/patch/altUrl.305.json) patch replaces the cloud urls with custom ones. Set the DNS entries for ```prod.revvox``` and ```rtnl.revvox``` to the TeddyCloud servers ip-address.
You may also edit the patch yourself to set the ip-address directly. Please beware, it should not be longer than the original url, which is 12 characters.
