# CC3235
Set the DNS entries for ```prod.de.tbs.toys``` and ```rtnl.bxcl.de``` to the TeddyCloud servers ip-address. Beware, this will cut off the connection of all tonieboxes within your network, which arn't patched with your replacement CA!
As an alternative you can set the gateway for the tonieboxes to the ip of teddyCloud. With OpenWRT it works this way:
```
uci set dhcp.teddycloud="tag"
uci set dhcp.teddycloud.dhcp_option="3,1.2.3.4" # 1.2.3.4=teddycloud ip

uci add dhcp host
uci set dhcp.@host[-1].name="toniebox_1"
uci set dhcp.@host[-1].mac="00:11:22:33:44:55" # toniebox mac
uci set dhcp.@host[-1].ip="1.2.3.101" # toniebox_1 ip
uci set dhcp.@host[-1].tag="teddycloud"
uci commit dhcp
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
```
