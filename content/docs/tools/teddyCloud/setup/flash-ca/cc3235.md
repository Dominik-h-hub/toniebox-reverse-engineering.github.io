# CC3235
Replace the original CA within your flash dump with the replacement CA and reflash it to your box.
```
cc3200tool -if cc32xx-flash.bin -of cc32xx-flash.customca.bin -d cc32xx write_file customca.der /cert/ca.der
```

```
flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/ttyACM0:921600 -w cc32xx-flash.bin --progress
```

If the box does not connect at all (codeword owl), you may try the old gencerts.sh to generate new certificates and reflash the box.
