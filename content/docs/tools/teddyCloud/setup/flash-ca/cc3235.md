# CC3235
Replace the original CA within your flash dump with the replacement CA and reflash it to your box. I recommend flashrom for that
```
cc3200tool -if cc32xx-flash.bin -of cc32xx-flash.customca.bin -d cc32xx write_file customca.der /cert/ca.der
```

[Please continue with DNS step for the CC3235](../../dns/cc3235)
