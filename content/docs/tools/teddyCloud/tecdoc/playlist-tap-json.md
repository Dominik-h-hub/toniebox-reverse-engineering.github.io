# Playlist Feature (TAP files)

TeddyCloud supports basic playlist handling. A playlist file (TAP) can be linked to multiple sources, as long as it is supported by ffmpeg. 

TAP files can be placed into library folder. The Tonies (from content folder) can then get assigned to any TAP file, just like it would be a normal TAF.

TAP files usually looks like the following:

```json
{
  "type": "tap",
  "audio_id": 0,
  "filepath": "lib://by/tapID/radio.taf",
  "name": "Radio",
  "files": [
    {
      "filepath": "lib://by/audioID/1234567890.taf",
      "name": "HÃ¶rspiel Tonie"
    },
    {
      "filepath": "lib://mp3/album/title.mp3",
      "name": "A Song"
    },
    {
      "filepath": "http://nas.intranet/musiclibrary/album/song.mp3",
      "name": "Network Audio"
    }
  ]
}
```
