# FAQ
## Is there a way to find out which kind of box I have...
### ... on the outside of the packaging (by serial)?
No, the packaging provides no information about that. The serial number just indictates when (year + week) and on which production line it was produced. As there a still boxes produces with CC3200 and CC3235 chips, you may also get them if you buy a recent one. Tonies even reuses old pcbs for new boxes. 
### ... on the outside of the toniebox itself (by mac)?
If the box has a MAC on its cap, you may check if its a ESP32 based one or not. You may use [macvendors](https://macvendors.com/) for that. Boxes without a MAC are most likely a CC3200 based one, as the MAC wasn't printed onto the CAP at the beginning.
