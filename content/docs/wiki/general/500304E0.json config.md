# 500304E0.json
Each folder on the Toniebox contains a file called `500304E0.json` alongside the actual audio content. This file contains the configuration for the content.

Usually it looks like the following by default:

```
{
	"live":	false,
	"nocloud":	false,
	"source":	"",
	"skip_seconds":	0,
	"cache":	false,
	"cloud_ruid":	"",
	"cloud_auth":	"",
	"cloud_override":	false,
	"tonie_model":	"",
	"_version":	5
}
```

## Examples

Custom audiobooks that you added to Teddycloud (no official Tonies) typically will have `nocloud` enabled:
```
TODO
```

Official Tonies will have the following default config:
```
TODO
```

You can download content right from an URL by setting the `source`. In combination with `nocloud` you can easily set up custom content:
```
TODO
```
