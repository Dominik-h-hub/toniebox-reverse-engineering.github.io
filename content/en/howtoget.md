Let's start from zero. You have just bought a brand new Toniebox or you just found your way to this website.

There are two paths you might choose from to get more out of your Toniebox.

## The easy way (techless)
You may already know creative tonies. This is the Tonies way to get your own content onto the box. We offer your an alternative way to replace all content on your Toniebox without the 90 minute or creative tonie only limit. You'll need to remove the microSD from your Box and put it into your computer. With our software TeddyBench you can edit the content on it. If you like you may also buy cheap SLIX-L Tags, assign your very own content to it with TeddyBench and design your own figurines or even create them together with your children.

## The complex way (tech-savy)
